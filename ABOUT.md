Make
====

A deck un-building game.


Objective
---------

Go from the biggest deck of 20 cards down a deck of 10 cards with the most victory points.


Gameplay
--------

Everybody starts with a deck of 20 cards, all zero-point resource cards.

* 6x Wood
* 6x Steel
* 5x Stone
* 2x Gold

On your turn, draw five cards from your deck. If you don't have enough, shuffle your discard pile (Dominon-style).

You may Make one card with what you have. Any card that you have Made may also be broken down to build more cards (and you get the leftover).

For example, suppose you have a Mining Pick, which you originally Made with 1 Steel and 1 Wood. Later, if you draw this card, you may Scrap your Mining Pick to get 1 Wood and 1 Steel.
