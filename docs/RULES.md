Rebuild
</div>

You need to build stuff. And then un-build that stuff... to build more stuff. To win, you'll need to create a deck with the most victory points. 1-4 players. Rules for Solo variant are at the end.

# Resources

There are four resources in this game: Wood, Steel, Stone, and Gold. These resources have no inherent value, but are used to build various cards throughout the game.

# Cards

The cards in the deck represent items that you are trying to build. Each card has the following:

* A **Title**
* **Resources** along the left side of the card (e.g. 1 Steel)
* **Victory Points (VP)** below the artwork, which are scored at game end
* Some cards have a Description along bottom, which provides special abilities.

The small, italicized text along the bottom is merely for theme - it has no impact on gameplay.

# Initial Setup

Go through the deck and separate the cards into the following decks:

* *Starter Cards*: Cards with 0 VP
* *Early Cards*: Cards with 1 to 4 VP
* *Late Cards*: Cards with 5 VP or higher

Divide the Starter cards among the players equally. each player gets the following:

* 2 *A Log* cards
* 2 *Bunch of Logs* cards
* 1 *Rusted Gears* cards
* 2 *Pile of Nails* cards
* 4 *A Stone* cards
* 3 *A Gold Bar* cards

Set aside one *A Gold Stack* card for each player. This will go into the deck.

Put any unused Starter cards back in the box.

Each player shuffles their Starter cards face down and places on the table in front of them. This is your **Player Deck**. Also, each player will have a **Discard Pile** (initially empty).

**Assemble The Deck**. Shuffle the Early Cards and Late Cards separately and face down. Place the Late Cards face down on the table first, then place the *Gold Stack* cards horizontally so that they stick out, then the Early Cards. This is the **Draw Deck**.

Draw the first 15 cards face-up from the Draw Deck and place them in a grid with 5 columns and 3 rows. Keep the Draw Deck near the top of the grid, and all cards facing the same direction. Cards along the bottom row are called the **Purchase Row**, and should be close enough for all players to read easily.

Determine a place at the table for the **Trash** pile, which is a shared pile of cards removed from the game.

Determine at random which player goes first. We suggest whoever has taken out their trash most recently. The 2nd/3rd/4th players may put 1/2/2 card(s) in their discard pile after looking at the purchase rows and before dealing their first hand.

# Gameplay

On your turn:

1. Draw 5 cards from your Draw Deck into your **Hand**.
2. Make any **Purchases** and/or **Plays**
3. Discard all cards in Hand and Played Cards to the Discard Pile
4. Trash the lowest VP card on the Purchase Row (tie goes to the left-most card). Shift the cards down that column and draw new card from the Draw Deck.

Whenever you Draw a card, you must take the top card from your Player Deck. If that deck is empty, you must immediately shuffle your Discard Pile face-down and that becomes your Player Deck.

Players may freely make purchases or play cards in any combination.

To **Purchase** a card, you must select a card from the Purchase Row, and provide other cards from your Hand with the necessary Resources. Place the newly purchased card on your Discard Pile.

*For example, to purchase a card that costs 2-Steel-and-1-Gold, Kelly Trashes 3 card(s): a 1-Steel, a 1-Steel, and 1-Gold card*.

Any "wasted" Resource from a purchase may not be recovered. (That is, a player may not "make change" with the trash pile or with other players.) Multiple purchase transactions may be combined so as not to waste resources.

*For example, Jo purchases a 1-Steel card and a 1-Wood card by trashing a 1-Wood-and-1-Steel.*

Immediately after Purchase, shift the cards on the table down the column of the purchased card. Draw a new card from the Draw Deck and place it at the top of the column. This makes a new card available for purchase on that same turn (even in the same transaction).

Bonuses from Played cards may apply to the cost of purchases.

To **Play** a card, place the card in front of you and do what the card says in the Description. Some example Descriptions are:

  * *Save 2 Steel this turn* - you may make a purchase without needing 2 Steel. You may split these savings between multiple purchases on the same turn.
  * *Draw 1 card* - draw a card from the Draw Deck (see Draw above).
  * *Up to two Wood may be used for any two resources* - if you have Wood available in your hand, you may use it as a substitute for any resource (can be different resources).

A Played Card may not be used in any Purchases (i.e. it is no longer in your hand).

Also, you will encounter the following Descriptions:

  * *At game end...* - the card is not invoked until the game ends
  * *Upon purchase...* - the card is invoked immediately when it is purchased instead of when it is played

When the **Gold Stack** cards are reached, distribute one to each player's discard pile.

The game ends when one column becomes empty and the Main Deck is exhausted.

# Scoring

Collect your Discard Pile and Deck and add up your total VP. Be sure to check the "At Game End..." cards. The player with the most VP wins. In case of a tie, the tied player with the fewest cards in their deck wins. Upon that tie, players share the victory.

# Solo/Cooperative Campaign

The solo variant of this game is about taking away all randomness except in the initial conditions.

The rules for gameplay are exactly the same, except for the following changes:

* At initial setup, instead of placing a 5-by-3 grid of cards, place *all* cards on the table with 6 columns instead of 5. Make sure that the Early cards are on the lower half and the Late cards are on the top half.
* At any time, you may rearrange your Discard pile in any order you like.
* Two cards are Trashed after each turn, with ties going to the tallest, then rightmost, column.
* At the end of game N in the campaign, you may keep N cards, each worth 4VP or less, in your deck (in addition to the usual Starter cards) for the next game.

For the game 1 in the campaign victory is at 50 points, for game 2 victory is at 55, then 60, then 70.
