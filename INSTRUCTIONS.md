# NAME_TBD

NAME_TBD is a game of building stuff. And then un-building that stuff. To build more stuff.

To win, you'll need to build up a deck with the most victory points.

# Resources

There are four resources in this game: Wood, Steel, Stone, and Gold. These resources have no inherent value, but are used to build various cards throughout the game.

# Cards

The cards in the deck represent items that you are trying to build. Each card has the following:

* A title
* Resources along the left side of the card (e.g. 1 Steel)
* Victory Points (VP) inside the shield icon

Some cards have a Description along bottom, which provides special abilities.

The small, italicized text along the bottom is merely for theme - it has no impact on gameplay.

Treat Resources like money, i.e. there's no difference between a Steel on one card and another.

# Initial Setup

Go through the deck and separate the cards into the following groups:
* *Starter Cards*: Cards with 0 VP
* *Early Cards*: Cards with 1 to 4 VP
* *Late Cards*: Cards with 5 VP or higher

Divide the Starter cards among the players equally. Each player gets the following:
* 2 *A Log* cards
* 2 *Bunch of Logs* cards
* 1 *Rusted Gears* cards
* 2 *Pile of Nails* cards
* 4 *A Stone* cards
* 3 *A Gold Bar* cards

Each player shuffles their Starter cards face down and places on the table in front of them. This is their Player Deck. Also, each player will have a Discard Pile (initially empty).

Shuffle the Early Cards and Late Cards separately and face down. Place the Late Cards face down on the table first, then the Early Cards. This is the Draw Deck.

Draw the first 15 cards face-up from the Draw Deck and place them in a grid with 5 columns and 3 rows. Keep the Draw Deck near the top of the grid, and all cards facing the same direction. Cards along the bottom row are called the Purchase Row, and should be close enough for all players to read easily.

Determine a place for the Trash pile, which is a shared pile of cards removed from the game.

Determine at random which player goes first. We suggest whoever has taken out their trash most recently.

# Gameplay

Each player's turn goes through the following steps:

1. Draw 5 cards from their Player Deck into their Hand.
2. Make Purchases and/or Plays
3. Discard all cards in Hand and Played Cards to the Discard Pile
4. Trash the lowest VP card on the Purchase Row (tie goes to the right-most card)

Whenever you Draw a card, you must take the top card from your Player Deck. If that deck is empty, you must immediately shuffle your Discard Pile face-down and that becomes your Player Deck.

Players may freely make purchases or play cards in any combination.

To Purchase a card, you must select a card from the Purchase Row, and provide other cards from your Hand with the necessary Resources. Place the newly purchased card on your Discard Pile.

*For example, to purchase a card that costs 2-Steel-and-1-Gold, Kelly Trashes 3 card(s): a 1-Steel, a 1-Steel, and 1-Gold card*.

Any "wasted" Resource from a purchase may not be recovered. (That is, a player may not "make change" with the trash pile or with other players.) Multiple purchase transactions may be combined so as not to waste resources. *For example, Jo purchases a 1-Steel card and a 1-Wood card by trashing a 1-Wood-and-1-Steel.*

Immediately after Purchase, shift the cards on the table down the column. Draw a new card from the Main Deck and place it at the top of the column. This makes a new card available for purchase on that same turn.

Bonuses from Played cards may apply to the cost of purchases.

To Play a card, place the card in front of you and do what the card says in the Description. Some example Descriptions are:
  * *-2 Wood per turn* - player may make a purchase without needing 2 Wood. You may be split between multiple purchases on the same turn.
  * *Draw 1 card* - draw a card from the Draw Deck (see Draw above).
  * *Up to two Wood may be used for any resource* - if you have Wood available in your hand, you may use it as a substitute for any resource (can be different).

A Played Card may not be used in any Purchases (i.e. it is not in your hand).

Also, you will encounter the following Descriptions
  * *At game end...* - the card is not invoked until the game ends
  * *Upon purchase...* - the card is invoked immediately when it is purchased instead of when it is played

The game ends when one column becomes empty and the Main Deck is exhausted.

# Scoring

Player collect their Discard Pile and Deck and add up their total VP. The player with the most VP wins. In case of a tie, the tied player with the fewest cards in their deck wins. Upon that tie, players share the victory.

# Solo/Cooperative Campaign

The solo variant of this game is about taking away all randomness except in the initial conditions.

The rules for gameplay are exactly the same, except for the following changes:

* At initial setup, instead of placing a 5-by-3 grid of cards, place *all* cards on the table with 6 columns instead of 5. Make sure that the Early cards are on the lower half and the Late cards are on the top half.
* At any time, you may rearrange your Discard pile in any order you like.
* Two cards are Trashed after each turn, with ties going to the tallest, then rightmost, column.
* At the end of game N in the campaign, you may keep N cards, each worth 4VP or less, in your deck (in addition to the usual Starter cards) for the next game.

For the game 1 in the campaign victory is at 50 points, for game 2 victory is at 55, then 60, then 70.
