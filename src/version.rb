  # Using an adapted version of Semantic Versioning (semver.og)
  # MAJOR.MINOR
  # MAJOR - bump when you make game-changing rules
  # MINOR - bump when you make usability fixes, but it's the same game
  # My convention: .alpha means this is under development.
  # 4.0.alpha < 4.0 because 4.0.alpha is "4.0 in progress"
  VERSION = '5.0'
